This script originally came from [thingiverse:64709](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:64709)
(which is a derivative of [thingiverse:62666](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:62666).
I also applied the changes from [thingiverse:850853](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:850853) to make
compatible with Python3.

I imported it to GitHub so I could more easily work on modifications.
